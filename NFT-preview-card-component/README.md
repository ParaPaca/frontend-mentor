## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

While working on this component, I finally managed to figure out position absolute. Now I will use this property more freely.

This project also became additional practice for me in using clamp.

```scss
.nft-img {
  background: url(./images/image-equilibrium.jpg) no-repeat top center / 100%;
  height: clamp(272px, 60vw, 302px);
  position: relative;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;

  &::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: rgba($cyan, 0.5);
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out;
  }

  &::after {
    content: url(./images/icon-view.svg);
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out;
  }

  &:hover {

    &::before,
    &::after {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In subsequent projects I will pay more detailed attention to positioning and such a relatively new method for me as clamp. This is extremely useful knowledge that I will put into practice. I also plan to start using frameworks such as Tailwind, Bootstrap and Material Design in subsequent components. Iâ€™m going to understand them and independently identify the pros and cons, and subsequently use the knowledge gained for the next projects.
