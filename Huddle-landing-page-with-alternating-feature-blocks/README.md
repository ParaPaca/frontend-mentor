## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS

### What I learned

First of all, I would like to say that at the time of writing this readme file, this project was the most difficult for me of all that I had done previously (in frontend-mentor and outside of it). Despite the fact that the level of this project is equal to JUNIOR, for me it turned out to be about a level more difficult.

This case was a challenge for me. In it, I was able to apply the knowledge gained in the process of creating previous projects on frontend-mentor, namely:

- HTML file structure - I started to devote more time to the structure of my projects so that it corresponds to the features of semantic layout.

- BEM methodology - I began to adhere to the BEM methodology and follow the recommendations for writing and using CSS classes.

- Classes - with each new project I try to simplify the structure of writing styles more and more. I began to overuse style nesting less, and also began to understate the specificity of classes as much as possible for better interaction with them.

- CSS custom properties - I began to use custom properties more often, but at the same time I remember not to abuse them.

- clamp() - I managed to delve deeply into the study of this function. It laid the foundation for my understanding of the max() and min() functions.

- Position property - I still practice using this property in my projects, and also make sure not to overdo it.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on the above and will also continue to take on more challenging projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Always helping me, when I'm stuck in my projects for different reasons.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Also very useful site.
- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/) - A lot of useful CSS-tricks.
