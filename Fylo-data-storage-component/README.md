## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project became additional practice for me in using clamp and grid templates. I also practiced writing animations for message-box.

```css
@keyframes bubbleHop {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }

  50% {
    transform: translateY(.3rem);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I will continue to practice clamp and animations.
